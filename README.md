# YourSpace - a social media platform (backend only)

## Description

Here is the backend for a social media platform called YourSpace built with JavaScript, MongoDB, and Mongoose with the ability to create a user, connect thoughts to that user, and connect reactions to those thoughts. The user also has the ability to connect with other users (friends). I tested all of the routes with Insomnia Core (see demo video under [Usage](#usage)).

## Challenges (and Successes)

- Challenge: Used the Week 18 Module as a model for this Challenge and it worked for the most part. Ran into issues with the Friends Routes and trying to figure out how they were different than the User Routes.

- Success: getting better aquainted with Insomnia, making folders to stay organized, and naming the routes better.

- Success: Used AskBCS and got a very helpful person who went through an explanation about what the routes functions needed that clicked for me.
